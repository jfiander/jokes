# Green Golfballs

## Jack's Sixth Birthday

Jack and his dad lived in a nice house in a quiet suburb. Jack's mom had died a few months ago, so he was still pretty upset about that. His birthday was coming up, so his dad maked him an offer.

"Jack, your birthday is coming up. To help you feel just a little bit better after we lost mom, I'd like to buy you something for your birthday. It can be anything at all. Just name it, and I'll get it for you."

Jack's dad wasn't wealthy, but his offer was sincere. Jack said, "Thanks, Dad. That's really nice of you." He sat there for a few minutes, then said, "Okay. For my birthday I'd like one green golfball."

Jack's dad was a bit surprised. He had been expecting something extravagant, like a trip to Disney World, or a nice new bike. But he said, "Alright, if you're sure." He went out, and bought a single, green golfball for his son, wrapped it up nicely, and gave it to him after dinner.

When Jack opened his gift, his dad asked him, "I'm curious, Jack. What's the green golfball for?"

Jack simply responded, "I'll tell you when the time is right, Dad."

## Jack's Tenth Birthday

Jack's tenth birthday arrived. That morning, his dad said to him, "Jack, you've reached a big milestone. Ten years! To celebrate, I'd like to buy you something for your birthday. It can be anything at all. Just name it, and I'll get it for you."

Jack smiled, then sat there for a few minutes. Finally, he said, "Okay. For my birthday, I'd like a bucket full of green golballs."

Jack's dad was plainly confused. He said, "Jack, I don't get it. Four years ago you asked me for a single green golfball, and said you'd explain later. Now you're asking for a whole bucket of them. Will I get to find out what they're for?"

Jack smiled politely, then simply said, "I'll tell you when the time is right, Dad."

His dad resigned himself to not learning this year what the golfballs were for, and went out to buy a bucket of green golfballs to wrap up for his son's birthday.

## Jack's Fourteenth Birthday

After working very hard, Jack finally received his driver's license, right on his fourteenth birthday. His dad, beaming at his son, said, "Jack, you're really becomming a grown man. I'm sure your mom would be so proud to see how you've grown. To celebrate, I'd like to buy you something for your birthday. It can be anything at all. Just name it, and I'll get it for you."

Jack thought about it for the whole drive home. As they pulled into the driveway, Jack told his dad, "I've decided what I want for my birthday. I'd like an entire car full of green golfballs."

"Jack. I don't get it," his dad said. "What's up with all of these green golfballs? Are you building something with them? Are you giving them away? What are they for?"

"I'll tell you when the time is right, Dad," was all Jack said in response.

## Jack's Eighteenth Birthday

Jack graduated valedictorian of his high school class. He had secured a full scholarship to Princeton. His dad couldn't be more proud of him. Driving home from the graduation ceremony, his dad couldn't stop talking about Jack's accomplishments over the past eighteen years. He took his son out to a celebratory dinner, and they spent the whole time talking and laughing.

After dinner, Jack's dad said to him, "Jack, you really have exceeded all of my highest expectations. You've become a better person than I could ever have hoped to become myself. You're a good friend. You respect your teachers. You mow all of our neighbors' lawns every week. You truly have earned all of the good things that have happened to you. For your birthday this year, I really want you to think hard about what you want as a gift. I've been saving up for this birthday all your life, so you really can ask me for anything at all, and I will get it for you. If you want a new car, it's yours. If you want a vacation to Hawaii, it's yours. Just name it!"

Jack didn't spend any time thinking about it, though. "I already know what I want for my birthday this year, Dad. I'd like a whole truck full of green golfballs."

"I thought you might say that..." his dad replied. "I have to at least ask, though: What are they for? Will I finally get to find out this year?"

Jack smiled brightly and said, "Yeah, Dad, I think the right time is almost here."

## The Accident

Jack's dad was at work when he got the call. His son's car was hit by a truck that was loaded with, of all things, hundreds of thousands of green golfballs...

He sprinted out of the office, jumped into his car, and flew down the highway to the hospital. He got there right after Jack had been wheeled into a recovery room. With tears in his eyes, Jack's dad burst into the room and gave his son a great big hug.

"I thought I might have lost you! I couldn't stand it if I did!"

Jack smiled weakly, and replied, "I think I'm going to be alright, Dad. The doctor said he was able to patch me all up."

Jack's dad gave him another big hug, then sat down beside the bed.

"Son... The whole drive here, I could only think about two things: your wonderful smile, and the gifts you've asked me for over the years. The only thing you've really ever asked of me is more and more green golfballs, and you always said you'd tell me when the time is right. Do you think you could tell me what all of the green golfballs are for now, so I could at least stop worrying about that, and focus on taking care of you?"

Jack responds, "Yeah, Dad, I think now's the right time," he said with a slight smile. "Okay. The green golfballs are forâ€”"

And he died.
