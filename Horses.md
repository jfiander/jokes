# Horses

## The First Week

Out in upstate New York, there's this run-down horse racing barn, run by a guy named Henry. He has two horses: a big one called Chestnut, and a small one called Tiny. Both horses enjoy nothing more than to race all day long, but Chestnut is clearly the better racer than Tiny, since he's just so much stronger. Henry knows this, and since the barn is really down on its luck, he goes and tells Tiny that unless he can race as well as Chestnut, he'll have no choice but to sell him to the glue factory to make ends meet. Tiny says, "I won't let you down, Henry." Henry responds, "I know, Tiny. I know."

Terrified of being sold to the factory, and annoyed by never beating Chestnut, Tiny decides that he's going to give it his absolute all. He asks the barn dog, Baxter, to help him train. Baxter heard what might happen to Tiny, so of course he agrees. He tells Tiny to start lifting weights. He leads Tiny out onto the track every day and encourgages him to beat his personal best each time he runs.

## The Second Week

A week later, Tiny races Chestnut again, and for the first quarter mile, he's in the lead, with the wind rushing through his mane. But eventually, Chestnut pulls ahead and wins the race. Henry sees Tiny's efforts, but reminds him that unless he can actually match Chestnut in racing, he'll have no choice but to sell him to the glue factory to make ends meet. Tiny says, "I understand, Henry. I really won't let you down." Henry responds, "I know, Tiny. I know."

Tiny's pissed off. He put in so much work, while Chestnut was just lounging around in the sun all day. Baxter tells Tiny, "Don't worry Tiny. I won't let him sell you to the glue factory. Together, we can beat Chestnut!" Tiny is more determined than ever to win a race. He starts training harder. Baxter brings him a punching bag, and he boxes with it all night long. Baxter brings in all sorts of things for Tiny to lift: tractor wheels, wine barrels, even donkeys. He's getting really buff. At this point, Tiny's thinking that Chestnut is bound to lose.

## The Third Week

A week later, they race again. For the first half of the race, Tiny is way ahead of Chestnut, and thinks he's definitely going to win this time. But as usual, Chestnut dashes past him with plenty of time left and wins the race comfortably. Henry walks by and tells Tiny that he can tell he's really trying, but unless Tiny can pull off a win, he'll have no choice but to sell him to the glue factory to make ends meet. Tiny says, "One more chance, Henry. I swear I won't let you down this time." Henry responds, "I know, Tiny. I know."

Tiny's got nothing to lose now. Baxter brings him some steroids and he starts popping them every hour. His muscles start bulging out of his skin. He's driven, almost crazed, by the need to win. Baxter trains Tiny day and night. After every run, Baxter mixes up a protein shake for Tiny. If he's not racing, he's lifting, with Baxter constantly pushing him to lift more. Tiny is convinced that he's gonna win this last race.

## The Fourth Week

A week later, the sun rises. They line up on the track. The race begins. Tiny takes a huge opening lead. Baxter's jumping up and down in excitement. Chestnut actually looks concerned that he might lose, and he might end up getting sold to the glue factory instead! Tiny is over the moon with his performance. He's going to win! There's no way he can lose, now!

Then he trips. He goes down hard, and Chestnut sprints past him and wins the race, yet again. Tiny gets up, uninjured, but dejected. He lost. Again. Henry starts walking over with Tiny's lead in hand, ready to take him out to the trailer, and Tiny just stands there, defeated. Henry tells Tiny that he has no choice but to sell him to the glue factory to make ends meet. Baxter trots over and says, "Aww, c'mon, Henry! Can't you see how hard Tiny's been working, just to stay here? He just tripped. Give him one more chance!"

Henry jumps back in shock and shouts: "Holy shit! A talking dog!"
